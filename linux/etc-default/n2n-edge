# Enable (1) or disable (0) HTTP tunneling instead of the normal UDP mechanism (experimental, optional).
# N2N_HTTPTUNNEL=0

# Enable (1) or disable (0) packet forwarding/routing through the n2n virtual LAN (optional).
# When disabled, packets arriving over n2n which are not for the $N2N_IP address are dropped.

# MTU of the edge interface in bytes (optional).
# MTU is the largest packet fragment size allowed to be moved throught the interface.
# The default is 1400.

# UDP port to bind edge (optional).
# Useful for keeping the same external socket across restarts of edge.
# N2N_PORT=

# MAC address of TAP interface (optional, RECOMMENDED).
# This is highly recommended as it means the same address will be used if edge stops and restarts.
# If this is not done, the ARP caches of all peers will be wrong
# and packets will not flow to this edge until the next ARP refresh.
# N2N_MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

# VLAN IPv4 address being claimed (MANDATORY).
# This is a private IP address.
# All IP addresses in an n2n community should belong to the same network (see netmask below).
# N2N_IP=a.b.c.d:port

# VLAN IPv4 netmask (optional).
# N2N_NETMASK=255.255.255.0

# N2n supernode IPv4 address:port to register to (MANDATORY).
# N2N_SUPERNODE=a.b.c.d:port

# N2n community name (MANDATORY).
# All edges within the same community look to be on the same VLAN (layer 2 network segment). 
# All edges communicating must use the same key and community name.
# N2N_COMMUNITY=

# ASCII text to generate the twofish encryption key (MANDATORY).
# All edges communicating must use the same key and community name.
