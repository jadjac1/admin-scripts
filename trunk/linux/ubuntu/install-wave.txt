Testing the Wave Reference Server (WRS) on Debian/Ubuntu server
===============================================================


If you have a new server, you can optionally install OpenNTPd for time synchronisation
and enable unattended security updates:

    wget -N http://admin-scripts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/linux/ubuntu/new-server
    cat new-server
    sudo sh new-server

    * If you run a JeOS (just enough OS) version, you may consider to use the new-jeos
      script instead, which also installs OpenSSH, bash completion, man pages and nano.


Get the WRS installation script:

    wget -N http://admin-scripts.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/linux/ubuntu/install-wave


Check the available options:

    sh install-wave --help


Install Sun Java 6, Openfire XMPP server and Wave protocol:

    sudo sh install-wave

    * You can use any available options to override the default settings,
      or remove the 'sudo' command to install wave for current user only.
      The installation script will still need sudo for a few commands though.

    * For unattended installation you need to accept the Sun Java License
      via the --accept-sun-java-license option.

    * Detailed installation protocols are created in the cache directory,
      see install-wave options for the specific location.

      http://groups.google.com/group/wave-protocol


Configure Openfire server according to the instructions provided by the script.


Run the wave server and the echoy agent:

    wave-server >&2 2>> ~/wave-server.log &
    wave-agent-echoey >&2 2>> ~/wave-agent-echoey.log &

    * Using 'sudo' to run them under root is neither needed, nor recommended.


Run your wave client:

    wave-client-console $USER


List available commands, start a new wave, open it, invite echoey, exchange greets and leave.

    /
    /new
    /open 0
    /add echoey@type-your-domain-here
    Hi!
    ^D

Check the wave server and the echoy agent processes, and quit them via TERM signal:

    ps -FC java|grep fedone[-]

    kill `ps -FC java|grep fedone[-]|awk '{print $2}'`

    * Bum, your waves are gonna now, they were only kept in memory.
    * I may update install-wave script to allow running server and agents as deamons
      when suitable with later WRS releases.


Current WRS version (0.2, as of 2009/09/25) limitations:

    * No wave persistence between server restarts (memory only, no RDBMS backend)
    * No robots or embedding API


Updating the WRS:

    * Feel free to run the install-wave script anytime to update the WRS.

    * Currently you need to specify all your custom options again,
      except for the XMPP secret key, which is automatically read
      from an existing installation.

    * Currently you also need to manually check the wave-protocol.log
      to see if there were any WRS updates and restart the server in that case.


Testing server federation:

    * You need to have an A and a SRV DNS records for your domain (server host FQDN)
      and also for a new wave subdomain of it ('wave.' + server host FQDN).

    * You can use the dig command to check if the records are set to the server IP.
      You may need to install dnsutils package first: 'sudo aptitude install dnsutils'.

        dig +short -t A `hostname --fqdn`
        dig +short -t A wave.`hostname --fqdn`

        dig +short -t SRV _xmpp-server._tcp.`hostname --fqdn`
        dig +short -t SRV _xmpp-server._tcp.wave.`hostname --fqdn`

    * If your server is behind NAT, you also need to forward port 5269 to the server.
